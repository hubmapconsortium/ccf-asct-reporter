## Search

This feature allows for AS, CT, and B to be searched and pinpointed in the visualization. The input auto-complete filters the entities based on the name. You can also search for multiple structures.

3. Multiple entities can be selected at once, and they will be highlighted in the visualization with a light-blue box around the name.

4. There are additional toggles at the top of the Search drop-down which let you filter the options by Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, and Biomarkers. Multiple structure types can be selected at once. Additional, the "Deselect All" button will deselect all checkboxes.
