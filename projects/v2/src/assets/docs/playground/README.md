## Playground
---

This feature allows you to play around with a sample visualization and upload your own data to be visualized. It also comes with an in-house table that can be edited to see the changes in the visualization in real time. Uploading your sheet/data is temporary, and once the page is refreshed, the link is terminated.

#### Usage

1. To activate playground mode, click on the *Playground* button on the toolbar.

   <br>
   <br>

2. This will take you to an example visualization with just a handful of nodes.

   <br>
   <br>

3. There are three tabs,
   - **Visualization**: This is the default view which shows the visualization (as shown in the image above).
   - **Table**: This is a tabular view of the data. This is not a full-featured table but a basic view for quick edits. Alternatively, you can edit your sheet on Google Sheets and then head over to the Reporter, click on the *Refresh* button, and get the latest data.

      <br>

   - **Upload**: This is where you can upload your own sheet. In the input field, paste your Google Sheet (or CSV) URL from your browser and hit the **Link** button to visualize your data.

#### Note

In order for the playground feature to work properly, make sure,

- The Google Sheet youâ€™re using has public access; permissions on Google should look something like this:

   <br>
   <br>
- Do not use the Share URL from Google Sheets (URLs ending with ?usp=sharing)
- Please copy and use the sheet URL from the Address bar like from below example.

   <br>
- The data should be in the format specified [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tK916JyG5ZSXW_cXfsyZnzXfjyoN-8B2GXLbYD6_vF0/edit#gid=559906129).
