## Visualization Controls
---

Due to the ever increasing data, the visualization can sometimes get messy and hard to read. The visualization Controls can be used to solve this problem by being able to resize the visualization and change the default configurations on the fly. These configurations can also be downloading in a JSON format. These controls can be found on the Control Pane on the left (figure below),

**Ontology IDs**

By default this option is switched on. Toggleing this options will show/hide the ontology names of nodes (if present) that can be found below the name of the node.


**Show all AS**

This is an options that is only visible in the [All Organ Visualization](/vis?sheet=all&version=latest). This is switched off by default and the visualization only renders the organ instead of all its anatomical structures and substructures. Toggling this to be on will show all the Anatomical structures and their substructures in the all organs visualization.


**Tree Width**

Sets the width of the partonomy tree (AS nodes).


**Tree Height**

Sets the height of the partonomy tree (AS nodes).


**Bimodal Distance X**

Sets the horizontal width of the bimodal nodes (distance between AS and CT nodes/CT and B nodes).


**Bimodal Distance Y**

Sets the vertical width of the bimodal nodes (distance between AS and CT nodes/CT and B nodes).
