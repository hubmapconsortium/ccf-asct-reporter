## Visualization Controls
---

Due to an ever-increasing amount of data, the visualization can sometimes get messy and hard to read. The visualization controls can be used to solve this problem by being able to resize the visualization and change the default configurations on the fly. These configurations can also be downloaded in a JSON format. These controls can be found on the control pane on the left (figure below),

**Ontology IDs**

This option is switched on by default. Toggling this option will show/hide the ontology names (if present) found below the name of the node.


**Show all AS**

This option is only visible in the *all-organs visualization*. This is switched off by default, and the visualization only renders the organ instead of all its anatomical structures and substructures. Toggling this on will show all the anatomical structures and their substructures in the all-organs visualization.


**Tree Width**

Sets the width of the partonomy tree (AS nodes).


**Tree Height**

Sets the height of the partonomy tree (AS nodes).


**Bimodal Distance X**

Sets the horizontal width of the bimodal nodes (distance between AS and CT nodes/CT and B nodes).


**Bimodal Distance Y**

Sets the vertical width of the bimodal nodes (distance between AS and CT nodes/CT and B nodes).

**Label Mismatch**

Toggling this option will show rectangular box around the text mark, whose name and lables are not same.

**ID Missing**

Toggling this option will show rectangular box around the text mark, whose id are not present.

**ID Duplication**

Toggling this option will show rectangular box around the text mark, whose id are duplicates.
