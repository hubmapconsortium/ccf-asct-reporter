## About
---

The ASCT+B Reporter includes a partonomy tree to display the relationships between various anatomical structures and their substructures, which is combined with a bimodal network that depicts the relationships between these anatomical structures, their cell types, and associated biomarkers. The interactive visualization empowers you to click on a particular node to inspect its relationships. The nodes in the visualization can also be sorted/sized based on number of linkages to gain additional insights on their relationships. Along with the visualization, the Reporter has many useful features like calculating statistics, comparing, searching and even temporarily uploading your own data into the visualization

#### Architecture

The ASCT+B Reporter is built using Angular 11 accompanied by a powerful state management system called NGXS that helps to maintain a predictable state container that makes it easier to understand how the data flow works in the application. It makes the application modular and helps with debugging and testing. The figure below shows all the components of the ASCT+B Reporter and how they are interlinked.
