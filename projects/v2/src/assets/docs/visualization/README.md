## Visualization
---

The [CCF ASCT+B Reporter](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter/) is a visualization tool for displaying anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarker (ASCT+B) authored by domain experts for different human organs. The tables are used to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) of the healthy human body, see also Hubmap Consortium website. The Reporter includes a partonomy tree that presents relationships between various anatomical structures and substructures, that is combined with their respective cell types and biomarkers via a bimodal network. The reporter also presents an indented list tree for a more traditional look. Along with visualizing, the reporter has a report generator that enlists various meta data for the visualized ASCT table, which is downloadable. There is also an in-house debug logger that lists any issues related to the data provided in the table. The reporter is also accompanied by a backend server, ASCT+B Data Miner.
