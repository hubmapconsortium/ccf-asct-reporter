The ASCT+B Reporter visualization can be saved out in PNG (Portable Network Graphics) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics File) format. The Vega Specification can also be exported in JSON format. The data that is currently being supplied to the visualization gets saved in this JSON too.

This can be done by clicking on the download button on the navigation toolbar on the top (beside the refresh icon) and selecting the suitable image format.
